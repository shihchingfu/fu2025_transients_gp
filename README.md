# fu2025_transients_gp
Computational notebooks accompanying "New metrics for identifying variables and transients in large astronomical surveys".

There are two notebooks describing the implementation of the same Bayesian hierarchical model in different probabilistic programming frameworks.

1. Quarto (.qmd): `stan` via the `cmdstanR` package in `R`
2. Jupyter (.ipynb): `pymc` in `python`

Data from a single light curve is included in the `data/` subdirectory.
